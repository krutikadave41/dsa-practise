#Leetcode Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/description/

#Intuition
We can solve this problem statement by maintaining a frequency map for each node. But that will be time complexity of O(n). Instead of that, we have to just find the common node

#Approach
1. Take first & second edge.
2. Find the common node & return.

#Time Complexity
O(1)

#Space Complexity 
O(1)
